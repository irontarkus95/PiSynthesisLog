# 1st to 5th October
    - We completed the user, system, functional and non-functional requirements.
    - We also completed the uml diagrams and specification for the system.
    - We had a meeting on Thursday in person to discuss what went on in class 
      and what Kyle said during the meeting. 
    - We discussed stakeholders, getting the sensors and the raspberry pi 
      and set up other meetings to be held everyday.
    
# Saturday 6th October
    - We had a meeting at 9:30 pm for an hour to discuss the contact of stakeholder, 
      getting a raspberry pi and ensuring that the sensors are working

# Sunday 7th October
    - Today I researched on which technology to use between DigitalOcean and Firebase,
      made a written Document, documenting the pros and cons, pricing, 
      what they both are and their features. 
      At the end, I decided that using both is best, 
      where DigitalOcean would be used for computing and cloud services, 
      and since it needs a database to be integrated and managed, 
      I decided to integrate Firebase into it since it is the easiest to use 
      and we all have experience with it. It is also much easier to manage.
    - I also created a github organization ‘PiDronics’, 
      created three repos and made develop and feature branches for each of them, 
      pushing the code we had so far. 
    - We had a meeting for an hour at 9:30 pm to talk about the tasks we did and 
      discuss the results we came up with from our research.
    - We decided to use real time db for Firebase, Digital Ocean after for computing, 
      React for the app.
    - I learnt how to use git pages and learnt more about Digital Ocean.
    - **Hours worked – 1-7pm** (lunch was from 4-5)

# Monday 8th October
    - Today, I researched on the different sensors needed for hydroponics 
      and the most effective way to automatically keep the environment optimal.
    - **Hours worked - 5-6pm**
    - I did not get to work as much as I wanted to as I overworked 
      for my job and it was really exhausting. I'm still learning to manage my time.

# Tuesday 9th October
    - Today, we met with our first stakeholder and obtained very useful information from 11-12pm.
    - I also worked with Michael to set up the sensors with the raspberry pi 
      and ensure that it is working.
    - **Hours worked - 6-8pm**
    
# Wednesday 10th October
    - Today, Michael and I could not attend UWI as he became horribly sick 
      and needed to go to the doctor :( 

# Thursday 11th October
    - Today we went to the doctor and did not get much done. 
      However, we still did some research on DigitalOcean and watch YouTube videos on how to use it.
    - **Hours worked - 6 - 7:30pm**
