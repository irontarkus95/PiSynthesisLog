# 15th to 19th September
- This week we discussed on whatsapp, the project we would be doing. We decided
to choose the same project that we started working on for Software Engineering 1. 
- We talked about:
    - The importance of getting stakeholders
    - Who are the Stakeholders
    - Shared what we did for Software Engineering 1
    - Discussed how to make the project better
    - Discussed the importance of communicating with stakeholders to develop the system.

# 24th to 28th September
- This week we met in person for a meeting, 
discussed the milestones to be completed, the user and system requirements. 
- We talked on whatsapp to discuss and complete milestone 1.
- We discussed how we will be meeting for the rest of the semester.
- We discussed the skills each of us have and how it would fit into the project.

# 1st to 5th October
- We completed the user, system, functional and non-functional requirements.
- We also completed the uml diagrams and specification for the system.
- We had a meeting on Thursday in person to discuss what went on in class 
and what Kyle said during the meeting. 
- We discussed stakeholders, getting the sensors and the raspberry pi 
and set up other meetings to be held everyday.

# Saturday 6th October
- We had a meeting at 9:30 pm for an hour to discuss the contact of stakeholder, 
getting a raspberry pi and ensuring that the sensors are working 
and discussed what we should do for the rest of the week. 
- We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner for the 1st iteration:
    - Scrum Master: [Qarun Bissoondial](https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial)
    - Product Owner: [Michael Ali](https://github.com/irontarkus95)

# Sunday 7th October
- Today I researched on which technology to use between DigitalOcean and Firebase,
made a written Document, documenting the pros and cons, pricing, 
what they both are and their features. 
At the end, I decided that using both is best, 
where DigitalOcean would be used for computing and cloud services, 
and since it needs a database to be integrated and managed, 
I decided to integrate Firebase into it since it is the easiest to use 
and we all have experience with it. It is also much easier to manage.
- I also created a github organization ‘PiDronics’, 
created three repos and made develop and feature branches for each of them, 
pushing the code we had so far. 
- We had a meeting for an hour at 9:30 pm to talk about the tasks we did and 
discuss the results we came up with from our research.
- We decided to use real time db for Firebase, Digital Ocean after for computing, 
React for the app.
- I learnt how to use git pages and learnt more about Digital Ocean.
- **Hours worked – 1-7pm** (lunch was from 4-5)

# Monday 8th October
- Today, I researched on the different sensors needed for hydroponics 
and the most effective way to automatically keep the environment optimal.
- I did not get to work as much as I wanted to as I overworked 
for my job and it was really exhausting. I'm still learning to manage my time.
- **Hours worked - 5-6pm**

# Tuesday 9th October
- Today, we met with our first stakeholder and obtained very useful information from 11-12pm.
- I also worked with Michael to set up the sensors with the raspberry pi 
and ensure that it is working.
- **Hours worked - 6-8pm**

# Wednesday 10th October
- Today, Michael and I could not attend UWI as he became horribly sick 
and needed to go to the doctor :( 

# Thursday 11th October
- Today Michael and I went to the doctor and did not get much done. 
However, I still did some research on DigitalOcean and watch YouTube videos on how to use it.
- **Hours worked - 6 - 7:30pm**

# Friday 12th October
- Today I researched on how to pull data from the raspberry pi into Firebase.
- I worked on writing the code to read data from the temperature/humidity sensor.
- **Hours worked - 6 - 9pm**

# Saturday 13th October
- I watched tutorials and learnt some React to help out with the front-end.
- I tried to make the web app responsive and look good on a mobile app, but it was of no use.
- I discussed with my team, possible designs and ways to make the app look good on mobile while also being readable and neat.
-- **Hours worked - 10- 4pm**

# Sunday 14th October
- I did further research on how to make our system completely autonomous.

# Monday 15th October
- We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner this week:
    - New Scrum Master: [Gabriela Sewdhan](https://github.com/princesszelda94)
    - New Product Owner: [Qarun Bissoondial](https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial)
- I planned out and assigned tasks for everyone for this week and made sure that we can finish it in time.

# Tuesday 16th October
- I worked with Michael to pull the sensor values into firebase and into the web app.
- We worked on Milestone 3: Most of it was done already, we were not sure about the "proof of methodology".
