<h1>Sunday 7th October</h1>
<p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li>Today I researched on which technology to use between DigitalOcean and Firebase and made a written Document, documenting the pros and cons, pricing, what they both are and their features. At the end, I decided that using both is best, where DigitalOcean would be used for computing and cloud services, and since it needs a database to be integrated and managed, I decided to integrate Firebase into it since it is the easiest to use and we all have experience with it. It is also much easier to manage.</li>
        <li>I also created a github organization ‘PiDronics’, created three repos and made develop and feature branches for each of them, pushing the code we had so far. </li>
        <li>We had a meeting for an hour at 9:30 pm to talk about the tasks we did and discuss the results we came up with from our research.</li>
        <li>We decided to use real time db for Firebase, Digital Ocean after for computing, React for the app.</li>
        <li>I learnt how to use git pages and learnt more about Digital Ocean.</li>
        <li>Hours worked – 1-7pm (lunch was from 4-5)</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Monday 8th October</h1>

    <ul style="list-style-type:square">

        <li>I did not get to work as much as I wanted to as I overworked for my job and it was really exhausting. I'm still learning to manage my time.</li>
